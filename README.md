#  Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn (whether a customer is likely to leave a bank). It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using **Streamlit**.

## Project Highlights

- Binary Classification with Keras/TensorFlow
- Model compiled with `binary_crossentropy` and `adam` optimizer
- Additional experiment with `mean_absolute_error` loss function
- Encoders and Scalers serialized with `pickle`
- Clean modular code with reusable notebooks and scripts
- Interactive UI built using **Streamlit**
